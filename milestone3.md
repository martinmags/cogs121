## New Proposal
**App Name**: *Xposure*<br>
**Description**:
Xposure is a competitive photography platform that aims to give talented startup photographers the exposure they deserve.

Every week the app selects 3 'collections' from a subset of collections using unsplash's API. Users can submit to these prompts, as well as review entries for each prompt. Reviews are standardized on a set criteria that provides constructive feedback to the photographer.

Submission + Review System
To encourage the whole system of improvement and competition, users that submit must also review another entry in the same prompt in order qualify for the weekly showcase. Reviewing in the same prompt provides the original poster a potentially different perspective or take on the prompt.

At the end of the week, the entry with the best overall review is showcased on the discover screen, and the cycle repeats.


**Target Audience**: *Photographers*

User is able to input their account information to access their account.<br>
![Sign In Screen](milestones/assets/one_speaker/skeleton/signin.png)<br>
User is able to create a new account.
Currently, the sign in page leads to the student flow and the create new account page leads to the teacher flow for better visualization. This will be fixed once we are able to determine whether users are teachers or students to display different things on the same html file. <br>
