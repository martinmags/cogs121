## Proposal 1
**App Name**: *Next Page*<br>
**Inspiration**:  Saw at church that the pianist would occasionally have another musician turn the page. <br>
**Description**
>Web App/Mobile Web App that accesses the devices' microphone, takes a PDF of a music sheet (or multiple PDFs), creates a decider on when to flip the page, and once the user triggers the unique signal then the music sheet automatically turns the page.
>
**Target Audience**: *Musicians that consistently practice and perform.*
> We appreciate music and some of us have an understanding of how to play an instrument, but collectively, we do not consider ourselves as musicians.
> 
> **Martin**: Played trumpet, mainly to keep my parents happy and get some scholarships.
> 
> **Ryan**: Played flute, and now, has no idea where it is.
>
> **Kai-ling**:

> **Roy**:

## Proposal 2
**App Name**: *Music Visualizer*<br>
**Inspiration**: Wondered what it would be like to be at a rave without hearing anything. Would the experience be that different?<br>
**Description**
>>Web App/Mobile Web App that is almost like a Spotify for the deaf or hard of hearing. It visualizes music tracks and syncs vibrations to the beat of the music to transform the act of hearing into a visual and somatosensory experience.
>
**Target Audience**: *Musicians that consistently practice and perform.*
> We are all lucky enough to be able to hear, and we empathize with the deaf community.
